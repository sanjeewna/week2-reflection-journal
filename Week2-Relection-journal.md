# Peer assessment #

Here I am going to rate my peer accordingy to their perfromance in a pair programming. 


Harpreet singh is good at work. From my prespective I wants to give 4 rating out of 5.

If I talk about myself then I always tried to understand all the topics taught my Mr. Sami in a session. Furthermore, I have an attitude of learning that motivates me to grow in life. In second week I wants to give 4.5 rating for myself.

# Challenges Faced #

Second week is quite challenging for me, as I learn many new tools and coding. During the week 02 I faced major challenge of understanding some topics, but Mr. Sami was there to explain those topics. 

# What Went Well and Lessons Learned: #

I learned many points but and one of the best thing that I learned from last week is that how to work in pair. This way helps me out to share my douts with my peers and get the best solutions for them. 

Key Learning: 

From 2nd week I leraned new fundamentals like Node js, Express.js, postman, how to push files into git hub. Moreover second week is very interesting for me, becasue I got to know more about new tools.

Like last week I got to know how to handle the project in agile methodology. This method develops the power of managing things in a real time.

# Final Thoughts: #

Week 2nd was very good for me as from this wek I got to know more abot other tools that will be used in future for making code. Moreover, after solving lab work I build more confidence to solve problems.

At the end I would like to thank Mr. Sami who explained things in a well ordered manner and cleared all my doubts.
